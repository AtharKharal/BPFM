```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```
Plan of the work:  

- Delete unique ID, too many NAs, rows with label==NA and columns not interpretable/meaningful ones  

- Lump all >5 and <30 labels as 'Yes'  

- Feature selection/importance and reduction  

- May use RF, ANN and Naive Bayes  


A glimpse into the structure of the dataset is given below:

```{r}
dt  <- read.csv("Blood_Pressure_data.csv")
glimpse(dt)
```
```{r}
length(unique(dt$diag_3))
```
```{r}
skimr::skim(dt)
```
